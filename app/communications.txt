COMMUNICATION SKILLS
Day 1
Inner Light Lesson on Assertiveness
What is Assertiveness?
Assertiveness is the light within you that allows you to express your thoughts,
feelings, and needs with honesty and respect. It’s about shining brightly without
dimming the light of others. Being assertive doesn’t mean being forceful or
submissive—it’s finding that balanced place where you respect yourself and the
people around you.
When you practice assertiveness, you strengthen your confidence, reduce self-
doubt, and open the door to healthier communication. It’s a skill—and like any skill, it
can be learned and nurtured with practice.
Types of Communication Styles
There are different ways people tend to communicate:
 Passive – You silence your own needs, putting others first at your own
expense.
 Aggressive – You push your needs forward but ignore or harm the needs of
others.
 Assertive – You honor both your needs and the needs of others with respect.
Assertiveness is the balanced path—where your Inner Light shines strong, without
overpowering or shrinking back.
Assertiveness is Not Aggression
Some people confuse assertiveness with aggression, but they are very different.
Assertiveness respects boundaries—both yours and others’. Aggression crosses
those boundaries.
Think of it this way:
 Assertiveness is a steady flame, warm and calm.
 Aggression is a wildfire, burning out of control.
Your Inner Light grows stronger when you express yourself kindly yet firmly, without
harming yourself or others.
Benefits of Assertiveness
 Clarity: You know what you want and can ask for it directly.
 Balance: You respect your needs and others’ needs equally.
 Peace: Less stress, resentment, and anxiety build up inside you.
 Growth: You create stronger, healthier relationships.
On the other hand, when we are not assertive, we may feel invisible, stressed, or
disconnected from ourselves. Over time, this can increase anxiety and leave us
feeling powerless.
Why We Become Unassertive
We are all born naturally assertive—babies cry when they need food or comfort. But
as we grow, our environment teaches us how to respond. Maybe you learned to stay
quiet to avoid conflict, or to always put others first. These patterns can shape how
you express yourself today.
The good news is: you can relearn and return to your natural assertiveness. Your
Inner Light is always there—it just needs space to shine.
Challenge of the Day: “Light Your Voice”
1. 2. 3. Reflect: Think of one small situation where you held back from speaking your
truth (e.g., not sharing an opinion in a group).
Act: Today, choose one moment—big or small—where you will speak up
respectfully for yourself. Use simple words like: “I feel…”, “I need…”, “I’d
prefer…”.
Note the Glow: Afterward, reflect on how it felt. Did you feel lighter?
Stronger? More connected?
DAY 2
Day 2 – Knowing What You Want in Communication
Lesson Title: Clarity Before Connection
Lesson Content (detailed for client):
Before you can communicate well with others, you need to be clear with yourself.
Communication becomes difficult when you don’t know what you truly want to
express. Many times, anxiety or fear clouds our message, and we either say too
little, too much, or avoid speaking at all.
This lesson helps you pause, reflect, and recognize your needs before you share
them with others.
Why Clarity Matters
 When you know your needs, you express yourself with confidence.
 Clear communication reduces misunderstandings.
 It prevents resentment from building up when your needs go unheard.
Simple Steps to Gain Clarity
1. Pause before speaking – Ask yourself: “What am I really trying to say?”
2. Use feeling + need statements – Example: “I feel nervous because I need
support.”
3. Set an intention – Decide what outcome you hope for before you start the
conversation.
Inner Light Perspective
Clarity is like polishing a lantern—when you know your truth, your Inner Light shines
brighter. It guides both you and the people around you.
Challenge of the Day: “Name Your Light”
1. 2. 3. Write down one situation where you usually stay quiet or feel anxious
speaking.
Ask yourself: “What do I really want in this situation?”
Practice saying it aloud in front of a mirror or to yourself, starting with “I feel…”
or “I need…”.
DAY 3
Day 3: Overcoming Communication Blockers
Lesson 1: Understanding Stress and Social Blockers
When you feel anxious or stressed before speaking, your body reacts as if it’s in
danger. This response is called the fight-or-flight reaction. Your heartbeat gets faster,
your palms sweat, and your mind may go blank. While this reaction is natural, it often
becomes a blocker to effective communication.
Blockers are the invisible barriers that stop you from expressing yourself freely. They
can appear in different ways:
 Mental blockers – negative self-talk, overthinking, or imagining worst-case
scenarios.
 Emotional blockers – low confidence, past failures, or fear of rejection.
 Physical blockers – shaky voice, dry mouth, or trembling hands.
 Social blockers – the belief that others are constantly judging or criticizing
you.
By learning to recognize these blockers, you gain the power to manage them. Stress
does not mean weakness—it simply shows that your body is preparing to do
something important. When you view stress as a sign of readiness rather than fear,
you begin to turn anxiety into a source of strength.
Inner Light Insight: Instead of saying “I’m anxious to speak,” try reframing it as “I’m
energized to share.” This small shift can reduce fear and boost confidence.
Lesson 2: Tools to Break Free and Build Confidence
Once you know what’s blocking you, the next step is to gently remove these barriers
with practice. Here are three powerful techniques:
1. Breathing Reset – When you feel overwhelmed, pause and take control of
your breath. Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 2, and exhale
slowly for 6. This calms your nervous system and clears your mind.
2. Thought Reframing – Replace negative thoughts with balanced, supportive
ones. For example, change “I will fail” to “I am prepared, and I will do my
best.” Over time, your brain learns to choose empowering thoughts instead of
fearful ones.
3. Safe Space Practice – Start small before facing bigger challenges. Speak in
front of a mirror, record a short video of yourself, or share an opinion with a
close friend. Every small success trains your mind to see communication as
safe and manageable.
Inner Light Reminder: Your blockers do not define you—they are simply passing
obstacles. With every practice, you allow your true self to shine through. The more
you act despite fear, the weaker those blockers become.
Day 3 Message for the Client
Your inner light is stronger than your fears. Stress and social blockers are like clouds
hiding the sun, but they cannot dim your true brightness. Each time you breathe,
reframe, and practice, you take another step toward confident, free communication.
DAY 4
Lesson 1
Assertiveness techniques
It include using "I" statements to express your feelings without blame, practicing the
Broken Record technique to repeat your point calmly, and using Fogging to
acknowledge criticism without engaging in an argument. Other key techniques
involve active listening, maintaining open body language, starting with small steps to
build confidence, and practicing before important conversations.
Verbal Techniques
 "I" Statements:
Focus on your own feelings and thoughts, rather than blaming others. For example,
say "I feel frustrated when the deadline is missed" instead of "You always miss the
deadline".
 Broken Record:
Calmly and persistently repeat your request or point without getting angry or
defensive, even if the other person tries to change the subject or argue.
 Fogging:
Acknowledge the other person's criticism without giving them more to argue about,
and then redirect the conversation to your needs or a solution.
 Active Listening:
Pay full attention, nod, ask clarifying questions, and paraphrase what the other
person is saying to show you understand their perspective.
 Self-Disclosure:
When appropriate, share your thoughts, feelings, or reactions to help build rapport
and provide context to your perspective.
Nonverbal Techniques
 Eye Contact: Maintain consistent, direct eye contact to convey sincerity and
confidence.
 Body Language: Adopt an open and upright posture to show confidence and
interest.
 Voice and Tone: Speak in a calm, clear, and steady tone. Avoid speaking too
softly or too loudly.
Preparation and Practice
 Start Small:
Begin by practicing assertiveness in low-stakes situations, like asking a waiter for a
different table.
 Rehearse:
Practice what you want to say beforehand, either by writing it down or role-playing
with a friend.
 Know Your Needs:
Identify and understand your own feelings and needs before you can effectively
express them to others.
 Manage Your Emotions:
Keep your emotions in check by using stress management techniques or simply
taking deep breaths to stay calm during a confrontation.
Mindset and Approach
 Know Your Rights: Be aware of your rights and stand up for them, while also
respecting the rights of others.
 Be Respectful: Assertiveness is about being direct and open, not aggressive
or hostile.
 Focus on Solutions: Look for collaborative solutions and alternatives that
benefit everyone involved.
Lesson 2
BODY LANGUAGE
Body language is nonverbal communication that includes our posture, hand gestures
and body movements.
We communicate through body language frequently in our daily lives, usually
subconsciously.
It was Albert Mehrabian who theorised that nonverbal communication, such as tone
of voice and facial expression collectively, make up 93% of all communication.
Meaning spoken words make up just 7%!
Assertiveness is not just about words—it’s also about how you present yourself.
Your body language communicates confidence, respect, and clarity long before your
words do. When aligned with your values, it helps you feel more in control and less
anxious.
Why Body Language Matters for Anxiety
 When anxious, many people slouch, avoid eye contact, or fidget—sending
signals of nervousness.
 Confident body language helps your brain feel calmer (mind–body
connection) and tells others you’re self-assured.
 Practicing body language gives you an “instant boost” of confidence in public
speaking, group discussions, or daily interactions.
Key Body Language Techniques for Assertiveness
1. Posture: Stand Tall, Sit Straight
o Keep your back straight and shoulders relaxed (not stiff).
o Imagine a string gently pulling your head upward—it gives a natural,
confident stance.
2. Eye Contact
o Maintain steady, friendly eye contact (not staring).
o In group settings, shift your gaze among people to connect with
everyone.
3. Facial Expressions
o A relaxed smile communicates warmth and confidence.
o Avoid tight jaws or forced expressions—they signal tension.
4. Gestures
o Use natural hand movements to emphasize points.
o Avoid crossing arms (signals defensiveness) or fidgeting (shows
nervousness).
5. Voice & Tone
o Speak clearly and at a moderate pace.
o Avoid rushing—pausing can actually make you sound more confident.
Inner Light Practice: Power Pose
 Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, hands on hips, and chest lifted for 2
minutes.
 Research shows this “power pose” lowers stress hormones and increases
confidence before speaking.
Bonus Challenge: Body Language Practice
 Pick one conversation today and practice confident body language: stand tall,
smile, and maintain eye contact.
 Afterward, reflect: Did I feel calmer? Did people respond differently?
Inner Light Reminder:
True communication is more than words. When your body language matches your
values, your presence itself becomes empowering—you radiate calm, confidence,
and authenticity.
Lesson 3
The Power of Saying No
Why Saying No Is Important
Many people say yes to things they don’t want to do—out of fear of judgment, guilt,
or anxiety. But every time you say yes to something that doesn’t align with your
values, you’re saying no to yourself.
Learning to say no is not about being rude or selfish. It’s about:
 Respecting your own values and priorities.
 Reducing stress and burnout.
 Building healthier, more honest relationships.
Common Myths About Saying No
❌ “If I say no, people won’t like me.”
✅ People respect honesty more than forced yeses.
❌ “Saying no is selfish.”
✅ Saying no protects your energy, so you can give your best when you truly mean
yes.
❌ “I must explain myself in detail.”
✅ A simple, respectful no is enough—you don’t always owe long explanations.
Assertive “No” Techniques
1. The Direct No
o Polite and clear: “No, thank you.”
o Best for simple requests.
2. The Values-Based No
o Link your refusal to your values:
“I appreciate the invite, but I need to focus on preparing for my
presentation today.”
3. The Alternative No
o Decline while suggesting another option:
“I can’t join today, but maybe next week?”
4. The Delayed No
o If unsure, buy time:
“Let me check my schedule and get back to you.”
Inner Light Reflection
Think of one time you said yes but wished you had said no. How would saying no
have honored your values and reduced your anxiety?
Day 4 Challenge: Practice Saying No
Challenge 1: Write down 3 situations where you usually say yes but want to say no.
Rehearse a simple, respectful response for each.
Challenge 2: Today, in one real situation, try saying no politely but confidently.
Notice how it feels afterward.
Inner Light Reminder:
Every no creates space for a bigger, more meaningful yes. By saying no to what
drains you, you’re saying yes to your growth, peace, and true self.

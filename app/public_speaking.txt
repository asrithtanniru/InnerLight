PUBLIC SPEAKING

DAY 1

Understanding Public Speaking Anxiety

Lesson: “Anxiety is Normal”

Public speaking anxiety is one of the most common fears in the world. In fact, almost 3 out of 4 people experience it. Even successful leaders, teachers, or actors who seem confident on stage have admitted that they still get nervous before facing an audience.

The truth is: the goal is not to eliminate anxiety. Instead, it’s about learning how to manage it and use it as fuel.

When you feel your heart beating fast, your palms sweating, or your voice trembling—this is your body’s natural “fight-or-flight” response. It means your body is preparing you to perform at your best. What feels like “fear” is often just your system giving you extra energy, alertness, and focus.

Instead of fighting the anxiety or trying to “make it go away,” the key is to:

• Accept it – Remind yourself, “This feeling is normal and temporary.”
• Channel it – Turn nervous energy into enthusiasm and passion.
• Practice gently – The more often you face small speaking moments, the more comfortable you’ll become.
Inner Light Insight
"Your nervousness is proof that you care about your message. With practice, this energy can transform into confidence."

 
Challenge for Day 1

Step 1: Write down your top 3 fears about public speaking.
For example:

• “I’m afraid I’ll forget my words.”
• “I’m worried people will judge me.”
• “I might look nervous, and everyone will notice.”
Step 2: Reframe each fear into a strength.
For example:

• If I forget my words, I can pause and smile—it shows I’m human, not a robot.
• If people judge me, it means they are paying attention. I can use that to engage them more.
• If I look nervous, that’s okay—my passion will still shine through.
Step 3: Practice acceptance.
Every time you feel nervous today, remind yourself:
“This is my body helping me. I am ready.”

 
 

DAY 2

Lesson 1

The Power of Breath

Lesson: “Breathe to Speak with Confidence”

When we get nervous, our body thinks we’re in danger—even though we’re just speaking in front of people. The brain sends signals that make the heart beat faster, muscles tighten, and breathing become shallow and quick. This is called the “fight-or-flight” response.

The problem? Shallow breathing feeds anxiety. You feel out of breath, your voice shakes, and your thoughts race.

The solution? Deep, controlled breathing.
Breathing slowly and deeply activates the parasympathetic nervous system (the body’s “calm mode”). This lowers your heart rate, relaxes your muscles, and clears your mind. With steady breath, your voice becomes stronger, your posture improves, and your anxiety decreases.

In fact, most professional speakers, singers, and actors practice breathing before stepping on stage. They don’t eliminate anxiety—they manage it with the breath.

 
Different Breathing Techniques

1. Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)
o Inhale through your nose for 4 counts
o Hold for 4 counts
o Exhale through your mouth for 4 counts
o Pause for 4 counts
o Repeat 4–5 times
📌 Great for calming nerves right before speaking.

2. Diaphragmatic Breathing (Belly Breathing)
o Put one hand on your chest, one on your belly
o Inhale deeply so your belly (not chest) rises
o Exhale slowly and fully
o Repeat 5–10 times
📌 Helps strengthen your voice and keeps you grounded.

3. Breath + Voice Practice
o Take a deep breath, then exhale slowly while saying “Ahhh” or reading a short sentence.
o Focus on making your sound steady and smooth.
📌 Builds control and reduces shaky voice.

 
Inner Light Insight

"Your breath is your secret weapon. Each slow inhale and exhale is a reminder: you are safe, you are steady, you are ready."

 
Challenge for Day 2

1. Morning Practice (5 min)
o Do box breathing as soon as you wake up. Notice how calm and clear you feel.
2. Voice Control Exercise (5 min)
o Practice speaking one paragraph while focusing on breathing from your belly. Record yourself if possible.
3. Real-Life Application
o Before talking in class, at work, or with a group today, pause and take 3 deep breaths. Notice the difference in your confidence.
 
Reflection Prompt 

• Did your breath feel shallow or deep before the exercise?
• How did your body change after practicing?
• Could you feel your voice sounding steadier?
 
By mastering your breath, you’re not just calming anxiety—you’re building a foundation for powerful, confident communication.

 
LESSON 2

The Keys to Public Speaking

Lesson: “Unlocking Confidence Through Simple Steps”

Public speaking may feel overwhelming, but the truth is—it’s a skill, not a talent. Just like riding a bicycle or learning to swim, anyone can become better with practice. There are a few key principles that every great speaker uses, and you can too.

 
1. Know Your Message, Not Just Your Words

• Don’t try to memorize every single sentence. Instead, focus on your main points.
• Ask yourself: “What do I really want people to remember after I speak?”
• When you know your message deeply, small mistakes won’t throw you off.
Inner Light Insight: “Confidence comes from connection, not perfection. People care more about your message than a perfect script.” 

 
2. Structure Your Speech

A clear structure helps both you and your audience.

• Introduction – Grab attention with a story, question, or surprising fact.
• Main Body – Share 2–3 key points with simple examples.
• Conclusion – End with a strong message or call to action.
Think of it like telling a story—beginning, middle, and end.

 
3. Practice with Intention

• Practice in front of a mirror or record yourself.
• Notice your tone, speed, and body language.
• Don’t aim for “perfect”—aim for “better than last time.”
 
4. Body Language is a Silent Speaker

• Stand tall—shoulders relaxed, feet firmly on the ground.
• Use hand gestures naturally (don’t keep them frozen or hidden).
• Make eye contact—it builds trust.
Your body often speaks louder than your words.

 
5. Pause and Breathe

• Pauses give weight to your message and give your audience time to absorb it.
• If you forget something, pause—don’t panic. A pause feels much shorter to the audience than it does to you.
 
6. Engage Your Audience

• Ask a question (real or rhetorical).
• Share a personal story—it makes you relatable.
• Smile—it sets the tone and makes people listen.
 
Inner Light Insight

"Great speakers are not the ones who speak without fear—they are the ones who speak with authenticity. Your voice has power because it’s uniquely yours."

 
Challenge

1. Mini-Speech (2 minutes)
o Pick a topic you care about (favorite hobby, a book, a personal experience).
o Record yourself speaking for 2 minutes, focusing on structure and body language.
2. Audience Connection
o Tell the same story to a friend or family member.
o Notice how their reaction changes when you use eye contact and pauses.
Reflection Prompt: 

• Which key felt most natural to you today?
• Which one do you want to practice more tomorrow?
 
By practicing these keys step by step, you’ll shift from nervous to natural—unlocking a confident speaker within you.

 
Day 3

Lesson 3: Visual Imagery

“See It, Feel It, Speak It”

Your mind is powerful. Sometimes, just imagining yourself speaking confidently can train your brain almost as effectively as doing it in real life. This is called visual imagery—a mental rehearsal technique used by athletes, performers, and public speakers to build confidence and reduce anxiety.

When you picture yourself on stage, standing tall, speaking clearly, and receiving positive reactions, your brain begins to believe it’s possible. Over time, this shifts your mindset from “I can’t” to “I can.”

How Visual Imagery Works

Visual imagery (mental rehearsal, visualization) is more than “daydreaming.” It’s a practical mental training tool that prepares your brain, body, and emotions for real performance. Here’s a clear, step-by-step explanation of why it works and how to use it effectively in your InnerLight practice.

1) The basic idea — your brain simulates experience

• When you vividly imagine an action (walking onto a stage, speaking a line), your brain activates many of the same planning and sensorimotor networks it uses during the real action.
• That overlap means rehearsal in the mind changes the brain’s preparedness: it builds familiarity, reduces surprise, and makes the real moment feel less novel and less threatening.
• Emotionally, imagining success produces mild positive feelings that strengthen belief in your ability (self-efficacy), which reduces avoidance and anxiety.
2) What visualization does for you

• Reduces novelty: The event feels like something your brain has “already done,” so surprise and panic lessen.
• Primes motor control: Breath timing, posture, and voice patterns practiced mentally become easier to execute physically.
• Regulates emotion: Repeated calm/positive imagery trains your nervous system to expect safety instead of threat.
• Builds confidence: Each successful mental rehearsal raises your sense of “I can do this,” which changes behavior in real situations.
3) How to visualize effectively — practical, evidence-based tips
Use these core principles when guiding users in InnerLight:

A. Make it vivid and multisensory

• Don’t only “see” the scene. Add sound (your voice, audience coughs), physical sensations (feet on the floor, warmth), smells, and emotions.
• The richer the sensory detail, the stronger the brain’s simulation.
B. Use the right viewpoint

• First-person (through your own eyes): Best for practicing internal sensations — breathing, posture, voice control.
• Third-person (watching yourself): Useful for adjusting style, posture, and nonverbal cues.
• Try both and note which helps you most.
C. Include obstacles + successful coping

• Don’t only imagine a perfect performance. Include likely challenges (a pause, a lost line, a distracted listener) and rehearse how you calmly recover. This builds resilience.
D. Keep it short and frequent

• 3–10 minutes per session is effective. Daily practice (or several short sessions per week) is better than one long session.
• Short pre-performance visualizations (1–2 minutes) work well right before speaking.
E. Combine with breathing and posture

• Start with 1–2 calm breaths, do the visualization, then finish with a grounding breath and a confident posture. This links the mental state to the body.
 
Quick 90-second guided script (copy into InnerLight audio/text)

1. Breathe in for 4, out for 6. Repeat twice.
2. Close your eyes. See the room and the people — soft details, colors, sounds.
3. Picture yourself stepping forward: feet steady, shoulders relaxed. Feel the air in your chest.
4. Hear your first sentence: calm, clear, measured. You breathe naturally between phrases.
5. Imagine one small pause — you breathe, smile, continue. The audience nods.
6. End by picturing a warm, satisfied feeling in your chest. Tell yourself: “I am prepared.” Open your eyes.
 
DAY 4

Cognitive Reappraisal: Changing the Story in Your Mind

What it is:
Cognitive reappraisal is the skill of changing the way you think about a stressful situation so that it feels less threatening and more manageable. It’s not about denying your feelings—it’s about reframing the meaning you give to the event.

 
1) Why reappraisal matters for communication and public speaking

• Anxiety starts in thoughts: “I’ll mess up,” “Everyone will judge me,” “I’m not good enough.”
• These thoughts act like gasoline on the fire of stress—intensifying your heart rate, sweaty palms, and shaky voice.
• Reappraisal doesn’t erase nervousness, but it reduces its power by giving your brain a calmer, more constructive interpretation.
 
2) How it works in the brain

• When you feel threatened, the amygdala (fear center) lights up, flooding you with stress signals.
• Reappraisal activates your prefrontal cortex (the “thinking” brain), which can reinterpret the meaning of the stress.
• Example: Instead of seeing a racing heart as danger → “This is my body giving me energy to do well.”
• Over time, repeated reappraisal builds a calmer baseline response in performance situations.
 
3) Step-by-step reappraisal process (InnerLight guide)

Step 1: Catch the thought
Notice the anxious thought that pops up. (e.g., “Everyone will laugh if I make a mistake.”)

Step 2: Question the thought
Ask: “Is this absolutely true? What’s the evidence?” (Most people are not paying as much attention as you think.)

Step 3: Reframe the meaning
Shift the thought into a more helpful one:

• Instead of: “They’ll laugh at me.”
• Try: “If I stumble, they’ll probably relate—they’ve all made mistakes too.”
Step 4: Practice replacement
Say the new thought out loud or write it down to strengthen the new association.

 
4) Examples of reappraisal for speaking anxiety

• Racing heart
o Old thought: “My heart is pounding, I’m panicking.”
o Reappraisal: “My body is charging me with energy to speak powerfully.”
• Audience judgment
o Old thought: “They’ll think I’m boring.”
o Reappraisal: “They came to listen—they want me to succeed.”
• Forgetting words
o Old thought: “If I forget, it’s proof I’m bad at this.”
o Reappraisal: “Forgetting happens to everyone. Pausing shows I’m calm and human.”
• Shaky voice
o Old thought: “They can hear I’m scared.”
o Reappraisal: “A slightly shaky voice at first is normal—it will steady as I continue.”
 
5) Challenge for the Day (InnerLight Practice)

Reappraisal Journal

• Write down 3 anxious thoughts you usually have before speaking.
• Next to each, write a reframed version that’s more supportive.
• Example:
o Fear: “I’ll forget everything.”
o Reframe: “Even if I forget, I can glance at notes—it shows I’m prepared, not weak.”
Optional extension: Before your next small speaking task (asking a question in class, talking in a group), use your reappraisal statements as affirmations.

 
6) Inner Light Insight

"Your thoughts are not facts—they are stories. Change the story, and you change the way your body responds."

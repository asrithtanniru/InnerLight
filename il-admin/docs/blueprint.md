## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Purple (#8B5CF6), provides a calming yet sophisticated feel, aligning with the wellness theme of InnerLight. Will be used extensively on buttons and primary interactive elements.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F5), provides a clean and neutral backdrop that allows content to stand out, while keeping the interface accessible.
- Accent color: Light blue (#95D0FC), introduces a subtle contrast. It will be strategically used to highlight key elements without overwhelming the primary purple theme, especially for interactive states.
- Font: 'Poppins' sans-serif for all text (headings, body, and labels).
- Emphasize clean, well-organized layouts utilizing Shadcn UI's Card, Separator, and ScrollArea components to maintain visual hierarchy and make navigation intuitive.
- Implement a responsive sidebar for navigation on larger screens and a bottom navigation on smaller screens for accessibility.
- Use subtle animations for state transitions (e.g., button hover effects, modal opening/closing) to provide visual feedback and enhance the user experience.
